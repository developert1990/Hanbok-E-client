                                    <p> Hanbok is a Korean word that refers to traditional Korean clothing. Hanbok is one of the most beautiful fashion styles in the world and has been beloved for over 2,000 years. You may have seen the hanbok in your favorite Korean drama, or your favorite K-Pop star wearing hanbok and wondered: what are they wearing? What kind of fashion style is hanbok? Where can I buy a hanbok?
        Hanbok is commonly worn by Koreans during major holidays, birthday celebrations (like dol), and weddings, but not many Korean people actually know about the deep history and significance behind traditional hanbok. Let's explore what is hanbok in this ultimate guide to Korean fashion.</p>

                                    <h3>Where does hanbok come from?</h3>
                                    <p> The embroidered patterns and the colors used on hanbok represented the ceremonial nature of the hanbok and social status. (The Korean royalty wore different hanbok than the commoners did.) Peonies, for example, are often found on wedding dresses to represent honor and wealth, while dragons and phoenixes were Korean hanbok patterns reserved for royal clothing.</p>

                                    <p>The women's hanbok has a short jacket called ‘jeogori’ paired with a full skirt that is called ‘chima’. The men’s hanbok has a short jacket, pants called 'baji’, and usually a short coat called 'baeja'. It is the same structure for children's hanbok, with the girls' hanbok being the same as the women's and the boys' hanbok with the men's styles.</p>

                                    <p>Western clothing is characterized by its straight-lined fabric and stitching techniques, but hanbok is completely different in its composition and design. Hanbok is made with flat fabric in a linear shape that only achieves dimensionality when someone wears it. In union with its wearer, the hanbok comes to life to be natural, elegant and flowing. It is a piece of art that you can wear and the hanbok becomes completed with your bright smile.</p>

                                    <p>The hanbok features straight and curved lines, which are representative of a uniquely Korean aesthetic and design. The graceful, harmonious movement that the hanbok allows, its deep hues and patterns, and its resemblance to nature come from over 2,000 years of the hanbok being worn by the Korean people.</p>
